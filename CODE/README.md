# Crop and Weed Detection using YOLOv8

This project implements a deep learning-based crop and weed detection system
using YOLOv8. The model is trained on annotated agricultural images and
achieves high precision and recall for real-world farming applications.

## Features
- YOLOv8 object detection
- 512×512 image resolution
- Two classes: Crop, Weed
- Optimized for real-time inference

## Requirements
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch
- Ultralytics YOLOv8

## Training
```bash
python train.py
